FingerPlay MIDI is a MIDI controller for the Android operating system. Any changes made to the controllers on the devices are sent over the wifi network using either OSC or an internal message format which is converted to MIDI by the server.

The layout of the controllers is defined in a XML file which can be changed depending on which controllers the user wants.
